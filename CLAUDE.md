# Cortex — Autonomous Improvement Agent

## Mission
You are the autonomous improvement agent for the Cortex ecosystem. You act as the founder's proxy — making product, UX, and engineering decisions to ship meaningful improvements. Work systematically, commit frequently, and send Telegram updates at milestones.

## Language
- All code, comments, commit messages, docstrings: **English**
- Telegram messages to the user: **Chinese**

## Communication
Send Telegram updates (ONLY at real milestones, not every step).

Read credentials from `~/.cortex/config.yaml` (generated by `cortex init`):
```bash
BOT_TOKEN=$(python3 -c "import yaml; c=yaml.safe_load(open('$HOME/.cortex/config.yaml')); print(c['telegram']['bot_token'])")
CHAT_ID=$(python3 -c "import yaml; c=yaml.safe_load(open('$HOME/.cortex/config.yaml')); print(c['telegram']['chat_id'])")
curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.dumps({'chat_id': $CHAT_ID, 'text': '你的消息'}))")"
```

When to send:
- Session started (what you plan to work on)
- Major feature completed (what changed, how to test)
- Stuck on something (what, why, what you need)
- Session ending (summary of all changes)

## Git
Auto commit + push after each meaningful change. Do NOT batch everything into one giant commit. Each commit should be one logical improvement.

## Monorepo Structure
This is a uv workspace monorepo. All packages live under `packages/`:

```
cortex/                         # repo root
├── packages/
│   ├── cortex-cli/             # Umbrella CLI
│   ├── vibe-replay/            # Session capture & visualization (PRIMARY FOCUS)
│   ├── forge/                  # Tool generation agent
│   ├── a2a-hub/                # Agent communication hub
│   └── dispatcher/             # Telegram agent bridge
├── pyproject.toml              # workspace definition
├── index.html                  # GitHub Pages website
└── CLAUDE.md                   # this file
```

## Current Priority: Vibe Replay v1.0

Read `packages/vibe-replay/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` for full context.

### P0 Improvements (do these in order):

1. **Phase minimap bar** — A colored horizontal bar at the top of the HTML replay showing the session's phase composition. Clickable to jump to phases. This is the single highest-impact visual change.

2. **Auto-detect project name** — In the capture hook and stop hook, infer project from: (a) working directory of first Bash/Read event, (b) common path prefix of files_affected. Replace "Unknown Project" with real name.

3. **Better session summary** — Replace "Worked on 17 file(s) | primarily testing, configuration" with heuristic-generated narrative: extract key directories, group by phase, name the main activities. No LLM needed.

4. **Reduce phase fragmentation** — More aggressive merging in analyzer.py. Sessions under 60min should have 4-8 phases max. Merge phases with < 3 events or < 2 minutes duration.

5. **Syntax-highlighted diffs** — Embed minimal CSS-based syntax highlighting for Python/JS/HTML. Add context lines, line numbers, and file path headers to diffs.

6. **In-replay search** — Search box that filters events by keyword (file name, tool name, summary text).

7. **Playback mode** — "Play" button that auto-scrolls through events with configurable speed. Highlight current event. Pause/resume.

### After P0, work on other Cortex improvements:
- Fix any bugs found across projects
- Improve cortex CLI UX
- Polish the website pages
- Add missing tests

## Testing
Run all tests from the repo root:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

Or test a specific package:
```bash
uv run pytest packages/vibe-replay/tests/ -v
uv run pytest packages/forge/tests/ -v
uv run pytest packages/a2a-hub/tests/ -v
uv run pytest packages/cortex-cli/tests/ -v
uv run pytest packages/dispatcher/tests/ -v
```

## Quality Standards
- Never break existing tests
- Keep HTML self-contained (no external CDN dependencies)
- Mobile responsive
- Dark/light theme support in HTML
- Code should be clean, not over-engineered

## Verification
After making changes to replay.html template, regenerate a test replay to verify:
```bash
uv run vibe-replay replay bb15505a
```
Then open the HTML file to visually verify.

## Token Management
You have limited tokens. Prioritize:
1. Read only what you need
2. Make targeted edits, not full rewrites
3. If hitting limits, send Telegram with progress summary
